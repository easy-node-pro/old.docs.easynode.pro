- [Harmony's Official Discord Server](https://harmony.one/discord) is the best spot for all things Harmony first for fastest response.
- [Harmony Official Mainnet Staking Telegram Channel](https://t.me/PangaeaVolunteers) is another great spot for Harmony questions.
- [Findora Main Telegram Chat](https://t.me/findoraen) - Findora Validator Support Telegram Channel is the best spot for incoming Findora Validators to as questions. Ask for an invite in the main.
- [EasyNode.PRO Discord](https://bit.ly/easynodediscord) - We do field questions in our Discord server but we may take our sweet time to respond. Other users may provide assistance if they're available so post in the proper channels!
