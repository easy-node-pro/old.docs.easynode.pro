## The Easy Node Way
When using our guides or tips you can always assume the following things that aren't really specified in the Harmony Documents. We call this "The Easy Node Way" which helps with organization and security:

-  Setup a user account to run harmony
  -  Don't use `root` or `harmony` as account names!!!
  -  We suggest your username as something like `serviceharmony`
-  Use a folder in your user home directory to store harmony
  -  We suggest /home/serviceharmony/harmony

## Validator Support Communities
There is no setup help or support officially provided to validators by the blockchains you are your own help desk. It's always best to fully learn your system before going live on a blockchain. If you do get stuck you can always ask for help in:
- [SERV Twitter](https://harmony.one/discord) is the best spot for all things Harmony first for fastest response.
- More soon!
